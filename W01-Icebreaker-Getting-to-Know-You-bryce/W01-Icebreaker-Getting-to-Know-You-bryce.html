    <p>As you can probably guess by that, I am super single but im sure I will find someone</p>
    <p>I am going down the applied science career path and looking more specificly as software engeneering but its a ways out. </p>
    <p>Web design should be a great tool for helping me learn more about codeing and just more in general about programming.</p>
    <p>I have been a member my entire life, was born in Las Vegas Nevada and moved to Millwauke Wisconsin shortly after and have lived here most of my life </p>
