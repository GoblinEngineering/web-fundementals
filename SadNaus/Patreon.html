                Sad Naus is a labor of love, we love the the CEDH comunity and love adressing your questions about it. but as a team we have limited time and money, so we put together a patreon so that with your support we can create more content for you, like live gameplay. everything donated goes towards the channel for better equipment for your viewing pleasure and prizes for future tournaments.
